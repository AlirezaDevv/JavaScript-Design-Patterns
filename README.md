# JavaScript Design Patterns

Welcome to the JavaScript Design Patterns repository! This repository aims to provide easy-to-understand examples of various design patterns implemented in JavaScript. Design patterns are reusable solutions to common problems in software design. They are templates designed to help write code that is easier to understand, maintain, and scale.

## Introduction

This repository contains examples of common design patterns used in JavaScript. Each design pattern includes a brief description, use cases, and an example implementation in JavaScript. The goal is to help developers understand how to use these patterns effectively in their own projects.

## Design Patterns

### Proxy Pattern

The Proxy Pattern provides a surrogate or placeholder for another object to control access to it. It is useful in scenarios where you want to add a layer of control before accessing the original object.

#### When to Use

- **Lazy initialization:** Delay the creation of an expensive object until it is absolutely necessary.
- **Access control:** Control access to the original object, especially when methods have restricted access.
- **Logging:** Keep track of the usage of the original object.

## How to Use

To use the examples in this repository, simply clone the repository and navigate to the pattern you are interested in. Each pattern is contained in its own directory with a detailed explanation and code example.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/# JavaScript Design Patterns
